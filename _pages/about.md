I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech, where I am advised by [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/people). My research is focused on the design of algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis toward online algorithms augmented with machine learning and robustness guarantees; I am also particularly motivated by applications in energy and sustainability. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before Caltech, I received an A.B. in applied math from Harvard. While there, I worked with [Boris Kozinsky](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/people/boris-kozinsky) on disorder-induced conductivity in solid electrolytes, and with [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) at UPenn on network science applied to semantic structure in texts.

I am a first-year PhD student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at [Caltech](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/), where I am advised by [Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/) and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). In my research, I am broadly interested in designing algorithms for online optimization, control, and learning, with a particular emphasis toward applications in energy and sustainability.

Prior to my time at Caltech, I received my AB in applied math from Harvard. While at Harvard, I wrote a thesis on optimizing solid electrolyte conductivity with disorder supervised by [Boris Kozinsky](https://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu/group/PrincipalInvestigator); I also worked with [Danielle Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal)'s group at Penn on semantic network structure and growth in math texts.
