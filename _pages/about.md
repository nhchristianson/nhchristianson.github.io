I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech, where I am advised by [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/people). My research is focused on the design of algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis toward online algorithms augmented with machine learning and robustness guarantees; I am also particularly motivated by applications in energy and sustainability. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before Caltech, I received an A.B. in applied math from Harvard. While there, I worked with [Boris Kozinsky](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/people/boris-kozinsky) on disorder-induced conductivity in solid electrolytes, and with [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) at UPenn on network science applied to semantic structure in texts.
