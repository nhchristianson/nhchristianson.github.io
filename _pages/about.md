I graduated from Harvard in May 2020 with an A.B. in Applied Mathematics, and will begin as a Ph.D. student at Caltech in [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/) in September. I am broadly interested in complex systems and their structure, dynamics, and control. Of particular interest to me are systems relevant to problems of energy and sustainability.

During my time at Harvard, I worked with [Boris Kozinsky](https://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu/group/PrincipalInvestigator) on the effect of disorder in facilitating ionic conduction in solid-state materials, and with [Danielle Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) at Penn on the structure and growth of semantic networks of concepts in mathematics text. I also spent some time my first year working with [Eric Peterson](https://chromotopy.org/) on computational methods for spectral sequence calculations. I am also passionate about pedagogy in the mathematical sciences: I spent the last six of my eight semesters at Harvard teaching or tutoring for courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
