I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/people). My research interests lie broadly in online algorithms, learning, and optimization, with an emphasis on developing learning-augmented algorithms with provable guarantees for problems in energy systems, carbon-aware computing, and sustainability. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before Caltech, I received an A.B. in applied math from Harvard. While there, I worked with [Boris Kozinsky](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/people/boris-kozinsky) on ionic transport, and with [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) at UPenn on applied network science.
