### Joining the group as a postdoc

I am recruiting postdocs to join my group at Johns Hopkins in Fall 2026. If you have a strong research background in algorithms, machine learning, and/or optimization and are passionate about translating theoretical insights into practical, real-world impact, **please email me with a brief description of your research interests and 3 representative papers**. I plan to start interviewing candidates in January.

### Joining the group as a PhD student

I am recruiting PhD students to join my group at Johns Hopkins in Fall 2026. I am specifically looking for curious, driven students who are interested in working on challenging, fundamental questions in algorithms and AI/ML as well as their application to real-world problems in energy, computing systems, and beyond.
I encourage applications from students with strong mathematical backgrounds, regardless of whether their prior training is in computer science, mathematics, physics, engineering, or related technical fields.
**If you're interested in working with me, please apply to the [JHU CS PhD program](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/phd-program/) (note the application deadline is December 15th) and mention me as a potential advisor in your application.** If you have any questions about application requirements, fees, etc., see the [PhD Admissions FAQ](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/phd-program/phd-admissions-faqs/). You're also welcome to email me directly to express your interest, but note that I won't be able to respond to all such emails.



### Joining the group as an undergrad or master's student

I look forward to working with JHU undergraduate and master's student researchers when I join in Fall 2026. If you are currently at Johns Hopkins and would be interested in working with me once I arrive, please reach out via email in Summer 2026.
