# Migration Status Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Ruby Issues (fix-ruby-issues branch) ✅
- Created documentation (CLAUDE.md) explaining the codebase
- Attempted to fix Ruby/Bundler permission issues by using vendor/bundle
- Added webrick gem for Jekyll 3.x compatibility
- Documented that system Ruby (2.6.10) has compatibility issues with github-pages gem

### 2. Migrated to al-folio v0.14.6 (al-folio-migration branch) ✅
- Successfully migrated all custom features to the latest al-folio template
- Converted HTML templates to Liquid format
- Preserved all customizations:
  - Email obfuscation (nchristi [at] caltech [dot] edu)
  - Clickable venue buttons in bibliography
  - Link preview cards for external links
  - Selected papers section with custom header
  - All content, pages, and bibliography

## Current Status

The migration is complete but the site cannot run locally due to Ruby version incompatibility:
- System Ruby 2.6.10 is too old for Jekyll 4.x and modern gems
- google-protobuf and sass-embedded require Ruby 3.0+

## Solutions to Run the Site

### Option 1: Use Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is installed
./docker-run.sh
```

### Option 2: Install Ruby 3.x with rbenv
```bash
# Install rbenv
brew install rbenv ruby-build

# Install Ruby 3.2
rbenv install 3.2.0
rbenv local 3.2.0

# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Option 3: Use GitHub Codespaces
Push the changes and use GitHub's cloud development environment which has proper Ruby versions pre-installed.

## Next Steps

1. **To view the site locally**: Install Docker Desktop and run `./docker-run.sh`
2. **To deploy**: The al-folio-migration branch uses GitHub Actions for deployment instead of github-pages gem
3. **Push the branch**: `git push -u origin al-folio-migration`

## Branch Summary

- **fix-ruby-issues**: Documents the Ruby issues but doesn't fully resolve them due to system Ruby limitations
- **al-folio-migration**: Complete migration to latest al-folio with all customizations preserved, ready for deployment with GitHub Actions
