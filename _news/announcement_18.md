I am at ACM SIGMETRICS in Stony Brook this week! We have [one paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3711701) in the main conference on learning-augmented spatiotemporal online allocation with applications to carbon-aware workload shifting, and I also co-organized the third annual workshop on [Learning-augmented Algorithms: Theory and Applications](https://learning-augmented-algorithms.github.io/).
