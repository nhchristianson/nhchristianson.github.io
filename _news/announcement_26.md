I gave a talk on [risk-sensitive online algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09859) in the [CS Theory Seminar](https://theory.cs.umass.edu/seminar) at UMass Amherst. Thanks to my wonderful collaborators [Adam Lechowicz](https://adamlechowicz.github.io/) and [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/) for hosting me!
