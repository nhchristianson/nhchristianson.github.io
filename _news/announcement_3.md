I am at ACM SIGMETRICS in Venice this week! We have [two](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626776) [papers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3673660.3655074) in the main conference on new (learning-augmented) algorithms for carbon-aware datacenter operation, and I will also be giving talks in our [Learning-augmented Algorithms](https://learning-augmented-algorithms.github.io/) workshop and the [MAMA](https://www.sigmetrics.org/mama/) workshop.
